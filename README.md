# Inferential_statistics_HumanBodyTemp_EDA
Trying to answer the following questions using this dataset.
1. Is the distribution of body temperatures normal?
2. Is the sample size large? Are the observations independent?
3. Is the true population mean really 98.6 degrees F?
4. At what temperature should we consider someone's temperature to be "abnormal"?
5. Is there a significant difference between males and females in normal temperature?
